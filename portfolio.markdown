## [Presenter - Improving Hyrax Bulk Imports by Customizing Bulkrax](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/10FaJYEDSsx52mYaHwg64MmfNPnFJaffCtRWJ2u9bG3k/edit#slide=id.p)
Spoke at [2022's Samvera Connect virtual conference](https://samveraconnect2022.sched.com/event/1D4BM/improving-hyrax-bulk-imports-by-customizing-bulkrax) about my work enhancing bulk ingestions of repository objects into Emory Libraries' Curate.

## [Emory Libraries' Curate](https://curate.library.emory.edu/)
[Github Link](https://github.com/emory-libraries/dlp-curate)

**Languages/Frameworks Utilized:** Ruby 2.7, Rails 5.1, Bootstrap, Hyrax, Bulkrax, Blacklight 7, SCSS, Devise, Omniauth/Shibboleth, jQuery, MySQL, Apache Solr, IIIF, Sidekiq, Webpacker, Capistrano, rSpec, Rubocop, CRON

**Description:** A repository application for digital curators (preservation, rights and metadata management, collection management).

**Recent Development Work:** I've been primarily responsible for implementing a object importing gem called [Bulkrax](https://github.com/samvera-labs/bulkrax) into our application in an attempt to improve ingestions of large works with multiple file sets. I've also participated in our software development team's upgrade of the root Rails Engine powering this application, called [Hyrax](https://github.com/samvera/hyrax).

## [Emory's Library Search](https://search.libraries.emory.edu)

**Description:** A customized library catalog search engine utilizing Solr collections updated four times daily by an automated OAI/MARC indexing process.

**Recent Development Work:** The creation and release of this site recently completed and further refinement and expansion projects have already been scheduled. I was heavily involved in all aspects of this site's development, but recently have refined indexing logic to correct the availability of cataloged items.

**Description:** A front-end application that queries Curate's Solr objects and displays their related images in varying resolutions dictated by a given user's rights access.

**Recent Development Work:** Since this site was officially released in early 2020, this application has occasionally needed mild maintenance and the rare new feature.
